        Bernard Berenson’s Drawings of the Florentine Painters is a digital
        resource based on Berenson’s publication of the same name. This research
        tool permits searches for any of the drawings listed in the three
        editions (<a href="http://www.worldcat.org/search?q=no%3A1985492"
          >1903</a
        >, <a href="http://www.worldcat.org/search?q=no%3A1159634">1938</a> in
        English;
        <a href="http://www.worldcat.org/search?q=no%3A11464141">1961</a>, in
        Italian). Filters allow browsing and searching by artist and title (as
        provided by Berenson, in English or Italian), location and technique.
        Each entry includes key information from all three editions of
        Berenson’s text, as well as the current location, an image of the
        catalog page, and plates included in 1903 and from the British Museum.
        Many entries for drawings by Sandro Botticelli and Filippino Lippi (and
        their schools), have been enriched to include links to museum webpages.

        This is the first online database to include of a large corpus of
        Italian Renaissance drawings from different collections. Berenson
        catalogued roughly 4000 sheets by painters active in Florence from
        14<sup>th</sup> through the mid-16<sup>th</sup> century; these are
        mainly figure drawings, from Taddeo Gaddi through Michelangelo.
        Berenson’s original three volumes, published in a luxury edition 1903 as
        <em
          >The drawings of the Florentine painters, classified, criticised and
          studied as documents in the history and appreciation of Tuscan art,
          with a copious catalogue raisonné</em
        >
        represent a revolution in both form an content. For the first time, a
        scholar had brought together essential information about drawings found
        in all known collections, public and private, and made them accessible
        in a single catalog. Berenson also include a series of essays on each
        artist (not included in this database) and reproductions of hundreds of
        works. Over a century after they first appeared, Berenson’s entries are
        still valued today by drawing specialists for their attributions and
        commentary. The three editions of Berenson’s monumental catalogue, and
        the very criteria used by Berenson to define his field of study, also
        provide a unique window on the development of art history. The
        conversion of the catalog to Linked Open Data, available at the Villa I
        Tatti
        <a href="http://data.itatti.harvard.edu" target="_blank"
          >data endpoint</a
        >, make it available in a machine-readable format. This allows
        researchers to mine the source content in ways that are currently
        difficult or impossible. The online catalog makes it extremely simple to
        search by technique, location, or keyword; the latter search includes
        titles and commentary in both English and Italian. The database also
        allows specialists to carry out more detailed analyses, e.g. to see how
        Berenson changed the attributions of individual drawings, or how he
        expanded or restricted the corpus of artists.
      </p>
      <p>
        Berenson’s catalogue entries have been transcribed and transformed into
        a digital dataset: the attribution, title, technique, and location, plus
        the commentary he included for many sheets. The indications for
        technique (e.g. the use of ink, metalpoint, wash) found in the 1961
        edition have been translated and standardized with terms from the
        <a href="http://www.getty.edu/research/tools/vocabularies/aat/"
          >Getty’s Art &amp; Architecture Thesaurus</a
        >. The names of cities and collections provided in 1961 have been
        translated and standardized with terms from
        <a href="http://www.geonames.org/">GeoNames</a> and the
        <a href="https://viaf.org/"
          >Virtual International Authority File (VIAF)</a
        >. In selected entries, especially for Botticelli and Filippino Lippi,
        information about location and inventory numbers was updated. Here, as
        in Berenson’s book, what constitutes a drawing resists a clear-cut
        definition. For example, Berenson might list a single sheet with
        markings on both sides as one work, or give separate numbers to the
        recto and a verso. Drawings might be part of a complex object such as a
        sketchbook, or else mounted together. In general, we have defined a
        drawing as an object to which Berenson assigned a catalog number.
        Sometimes --as in the case of several drawings mounted together-- we
        have deviated from Berenson’s system; in line with modern cataloging
        practice, we assign an identifier to each drawing.
      </p>
      <p>
        This project began by converting the content of Berenson’s publications
        into a Linked Open dataset, and providing a search interface that will
        support resource discovery and data analysis. For Botticelli and
        Filippino Lippi, the content was enriched through interlinking with
        online museum catalogues that provide researchers with updated
        information and illustrations. In contrast to a traditional database,
        where all data remain on the host’s website, the linked catalogue allows
        researchers to have direct access to the data through open data services
        like a SPARQL endpoint and a data dump.
      </p>
      <p>
        The database aims to serve as a representative use case. The
        infrastructure and methodological framework could be applied to similar
        art history initiatives which focus on scholarly inventories, narrative
        articles, and photographic documentation. The database itself could be
        incorporated into a larger one that included, for example, other forms
        of art, or drawings from different areas or periods.
